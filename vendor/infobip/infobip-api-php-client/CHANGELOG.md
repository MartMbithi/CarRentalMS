üéâ **NEW Major Version**

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT NOTE:** This release contains breaking changes!

In this release, the library is vastly changed and modernized. It is auto-generated and completely different from the previous version, so we do not provide an upgrade guide from 2.x to 3.x because such a document will be a similar size as the library itself.

### Added
- Support for async execution

- Support for [Infobip Two-factor Authentication API](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api#channels/sms/send-2fa-pin-code-over-sms)

### Changed
- Models, structure, examples, etc. for [Infobip SMS API](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api#channels/sms)
- Library dependencies
- `README.md` which contains necessary data and examples for quickstart as well as some other important pieces of information on versioning, licensing, etc.
- LICENSE which is now MIT

### Removed
- Support for [Infobip Omni API](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api#channels/omni-failover) (to be included back in one of the next releases)
